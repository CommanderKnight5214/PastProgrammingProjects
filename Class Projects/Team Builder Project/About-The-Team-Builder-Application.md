# About The Team Builder Application

This Project was a Team Project for my Software Engineering Class. My teams main objective for this project, was to create a program that helped the user to create an even number of teams, given a list of names that would provided by the user. The final application that we would create is known as the Team Builder Application, and my main role throughout this project was to be the Team Leader. This role consisted of me managing the project, deligating people to where they were needed under the role that each team member was given, and I also helped in any area of the project where my team members needed any assitance as well. My biggest takeaway from this project was the experience that I gained from being a team leader, which not only helped my overall character. But this project also helped me to understand what it is like to design an application from beginning to end, using the Software Development Life Cycle. The final result of this application can be seen in the screenshot below.
