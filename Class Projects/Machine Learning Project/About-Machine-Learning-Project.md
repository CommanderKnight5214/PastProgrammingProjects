# About The Machine Learning Project

This project was completed during my Machine Learning Class, and my main objective for this project was to create a project using the tools and libraries that were geared towards Machine Learning. For my project, I came across a dataset of registered cars from the state of Washington, and using this dataset. I decided try and figure out the best Clean Alternative Car (or a car that uses little to no gas emissions,) by creating a graph. In addition to creating a graph I used the Max Curb Weight in lbs, and the Electric Range as X and Y Cordnates to plot on my graph, in order to generate a graph of all the cars. The Algorithm that I used to create my project was from the scikit-learn python library, and I also used the pandas library to read in the parameters that I was going to use for my graph. This project helped me to learn how a Machine Learning Algorithm can create a graph that is acurrate and useful, and here is a screenshot of the final graph that I generated, based off of the first 800 cars that I evaluated.
