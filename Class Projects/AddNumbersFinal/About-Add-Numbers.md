# About The Add Numbers Project

This Project was a progressive project during my Software Engineering Class, in which I had to build up the application with a new set of requirements each time. Overall, this project taught me what it means to follow a given set of requirements for a programming project, and the final product that resulted from this project is shown in the preview below.
