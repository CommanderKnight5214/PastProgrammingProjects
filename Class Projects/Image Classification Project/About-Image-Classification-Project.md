# About The Image Classfication Project

This project was completed during my Advanced Artificial Intelligence Class, and my main objective for this project was to create a project using the tools and libraries that were geared towards Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning. For my project, I decided to research into some Image Classfication Algorithms, and I came across a tutorial that designed an Image Classfication Algorithm from scatch. Once I followed this turtorial, I then proceeded to classify different breeds of cats using the algorithm, which helped me to determine how accurate the Algorithm was, while also classfing different breeds of cats. This project helped me to learn how an Image Classification Algorithm can work, and here are some screenshots of five cats that I classfied, along with their accuracies.
