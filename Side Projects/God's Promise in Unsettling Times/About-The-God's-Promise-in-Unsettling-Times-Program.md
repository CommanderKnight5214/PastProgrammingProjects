# About The God's Promise in Unsettling Times Program

This program was created during the COVID-19 Lockdown when I was a Freshman in College. While this program is very simple in nature, while also drawing from my background as a Christian. I created this program with the sole purpose to comfort fellow students at my university that were struggling during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This program is one of the first major programs that I had created as an individual side project, and here are the current screenshots of the program that I created.
