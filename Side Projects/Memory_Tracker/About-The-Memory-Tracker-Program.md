# About The Memory Tracker Program

The Memory Tracker Program was created during a time where I thought that a close grandparent of mine had dementia. I created this program to help my Grandmother log my Grandfathers dementia progression, so that she could evaluate what stage my Grandfather is at in terms of his dementia, which also helps my Grandmother to evaluate when she needs to take my Grandfather to a Senior Living Facility. Where the nurses can provide more care to my Grandfather when it is necessary. This program was very useful to my Grandmother when we thought my Granfather had dementia, and here is a preview of what the application looks like.
