# About The Storage Calculator Application

The Storage Calculator Application was created to help me do some storage calculations that I needed to calculate for a different side project. The program will do some basic storage calculations, such as calculating Megabytes to Gigabytes, and while the program is not a finished product. The program does what it was intended to do, which was to do some storage calculations in a calculator format. The following program is shown in the screenshot below, and the only features that don't work, is the reset button, and the menu tabs.
