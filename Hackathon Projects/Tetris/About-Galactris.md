# About Galactris

Galactris is the first Hackathon project that I worked on during one of these Hackathon Events. Our group's main objective was to create a Python Application, and our group desided to replicate the game of Tetris, which is known as Galactris. While I did not code any part of the application since I was a Freshman at the time, I did find all of the images that were needed for the application, as well as various sounds that were needed for the applicatin as wel . This experience was memorable to me because this was the first Hackathon Event that I attended, and here are two of the screenshots of the application.
