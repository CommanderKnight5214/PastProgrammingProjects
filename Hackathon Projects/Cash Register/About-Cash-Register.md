# About The Cash Register Application

The Cash Register Application was completed during a hackathon event, by the team that I was on as a team member. Our team at this event had the objective to create an application using C#, and we desided to create a Cash Register Application using Windows Forms. For this application, I helped to create the button mechanism that adds each food to the order, and I also added a multiplier functionality, which allows the user to add multiple sandwichs and sides with one button click. In addition to this, I also helped to create a date and time functionailty, and I also found some images for the sandwitches as well. The following application that I helped to create is shown in the preview below.
